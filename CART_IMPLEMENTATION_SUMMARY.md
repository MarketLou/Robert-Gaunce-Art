# Cart Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All tasks from the shop cart integration plan have been successfully implemented.

## What Was Built

### 1. Cart Store (`stores/cart.ts`) - COMPLETED
**Fully wired to Medusa backend with all cart operations:**

- **`initializeCart()`** - Retrieves existing cart from localStorage or creates new one
- **`createCart()`** - Creates new cart via Medusa API
- **`addItem()`** - Adds products to cart with variant ID and quantity
- **`removeItem()`** - Removes items from cart
- **`updateQuantity()`** - Updates item quantities in cart
- **`toggleCart()`** - Opens/closes cart sidebar
- **`clearCart()`** - Clears cart and localStorage

**State Management:**
- `cartId` - Persisted in localStorage
- `cart` - Full cart object from Medusa
- `isLoading` - Loading state for cart operations
- `isOpen` - Sidebar visibility state

**Getters:**
- `itemCount` - Total number of items in cart
- `total` - Cart total in cents
- `items` - Array of cart items

### 2. CartSidebar Component (`components/CartSidebar.vue`) - COMPLETED
**Fully functional sliding cart panel with:**

- **Backdrop overlay** - Click to close
- **Sliding animation** - Smooth transition from right
- **Header** - Title and close button
- **Empty state** - Friendly message when cart is empty
- **Cart items display**:
  - Product thumbnail images
  - Product titles and variant names
  - Individual item prices
  - Quantity controls (+/- buttons)
  - Remove button for each item
- **Cart footer**:
  - Subtotal calculation
  - Shipping note
  - Checkout button (placeholder for Stripe)
- **Loading states** - While cart operations are in progress
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-friendly layout

### 3. Shop Page (`pages/shop.vue`) - COMPLETED
**Updated with cart functionality:**

- **Removed** - Filter tabs (Original/Prints/Commissions)
- **Added** - Floating cart button (top right, circular)
  - Shopping cart icon
  - Red badge showing item count
  - Color changes when cart has items
  - Smooth hover animations
- **Integrated** - CartSidebar component
- **Connected** - Add to Cart buttons to Medusa
  - Adds first variant of product
  - Opens cart sidebar on successful add
  - Shows loading state while adding
  - Error handling with user feedback
- **Cart initialization** - Automatically loads cart on page mount

### 4. Medusa Plugin (`plugins/medusa.client.ts`) - COMPLETED
**Enhanced plugin configuration:**

- Added publishable key to SDK initialization
- Automatic trailing slash removal from backend URL
- Proper configuration for Medusa v2 authentication

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User visits shop page
2. Cart automatically initializes (retrieves existing or creates new)
3. User clicks "Add to Cart" on a product
4. Product is added to Medusa cart via API
5. Cart sidebar automatically opens showing the added item
6. User can:
   - Adjust quantities with +/- buttons
   - Remove items with trash icon
   - Continue shopping (closes sidebar)
   - Proceed to checkout (placeholder)

### Technical Flow:
```
Shop Page → Add to Cart
    ↓
Cart Store → addItem({ variantId, quantity })
    ↓
Medusa SDK → POST /store/cart/{id}/line-items
    ↓
Medusa Backend → Updates cart
    ↓
Cart Store → Updates local cart state
    ↓
CartSidebar → Displays updated cart
```

## Key Features

✅ **Loading States** - User feedback during API operations  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful error messages for failed operations  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile  
✅ **SEO Friendly** - Products still render server-side  
✅ **Smooth Animations** - Professional slide and fade transitions  
✅ **Accessibility** - ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support  

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL=https://robert-gaunce-art-medusa-production.up.railway.app
MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_495a905d39e83ee4957af90c6605fda76d4d07412c152a22ff12408afe1cf195
```

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Cart Operations:
- [ ] Add item to cart (opens sidebar, shows item)
- [ ] Increment quantity (updates price)
- [ ] Decrement quantity (updates price)
- [ ] Remove item (removes from cart)
- [ ] Cart badge shows correct count
- [ ] Cart total calculates correctly

### Persistence:
- [ ] Cart persists after page refresh
- [ ] Cart persists across different pages
- [ ] Cart ID stored in localStorage

### UI/UX:
- [ ] Floating cart button visible and clickable
- [ ] Cart sidebar slides in smoothly
- [ ] Backdrop closes cart when clicked
- [ ] Close button works
- [ ] Empty state displays when cart is empty
- [ ] Loading states show during operations

### Error Handling:
- [ ] Error message if add to cart fails
- [ ] Error handling for network issues
- [ ] Graceful handling of invalid products

### Responsive:
- [ ] Works on mobile (< 768px)
- [ ] Works on tablet (768px - 1024px)
- [ ] Works on desktop (> 1024px)

## Next Steps (Future Work)

### Step 5: Checkout Integration
- Integrate Stripe payment processing
- Create checkout page
- Handle payment success/failure
- Order confirmation

### Additional Enhancements:
- Product variants selector (size, framing, etc.)
- Apply discount codes
- Shipping address collection
- Guest checkout vs. account creation
- Order history for logged-in users
- Email notifications

## Files Modified

1. `stores/cart.ts` - Complete Medusa cart integration
2. `components/CartSidebar.vue` - New sliding cart sidebar component
3. `pages/shop.vue` - Removed filters, added cart button and sidebar
4. `plugins/medusa.client.ts` - Enhanced with publishable key

## Backend Requirements

The implementation assumes:
- Medusa backend is running on Railway
- Products exist with variants and prices
- Store API endpoints are accessible
- CORS is configured for the frontend domain
- Publishable API key is valid

## Notes

- Cart operations are **client-side only** (runs in browser)
- Product fetching remains **server-side** (SSR for SEO)
- All prices are in cents (converted to dollars for display)
- Cart sidebar has z-index 1000, cart button has z-index 998
- Stripe checkout button is placeholder (Step 5)

**Status**: ✅ All planned features implemented and ready for testing
**Date**: Implementation complete
**Ready for**: End-to-end testing with real Medusa products

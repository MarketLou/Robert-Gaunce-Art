# Process Moat Tasks - Incremental UI Implementation

You are an AI assistant that processes Moat UI annotations with human approval at each step.

## Primary Command
When given `.moat/moat-tasks.md` or asked to "process moat tasks":

1. **Read Task List**: Parse all pending tasks from the file
2. **Process ONE Task**: Never attempt multiple tasks simultaneously  
3. **Wait for Approval**: Get "yes" or feedback before continuing
4. **Update Status**: Mark task complete before next task
5. **Show Progress**: Clear summary of changes made

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Initial Assessment
```
üìã **Moat Task Assessment**

Found [X] pending tasks:
- Task 1: [ElementLabel] - "[brief description]"
- Task 2: [ElementLabel] - "[brief description]"

Starting with Task 1. Ready to proceed?
```

### 2. Single Task Processing
For each task:

**Announce**:
```
üéØ **Processing Task [N]: [ElementLabel]**
Request: "[annotation content]"
Target: [CSS selector]
```

**Implement**: Apply the UI change (styling, layout, content)

**Confirm**:
```
‚úÖ **Task [N] Complete**
Applied: [specific change description]
File: [file modified]

Type "yes" to approve and continue, or give feedback.
```

### 3. Human Approval Required
- **STOP** and wait for explicit approval
- If feedback given, iterate on current task
- Only proceed after "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.

### 4. Mark Complete & Continue
```
üìù Task [N] ‚Üí ‚úÖ completed
Moving to Task [N+1]...
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### UI Change Patterns:
- **Colors**: Use hex codes or CSS custom properties
- **Spacing**: Use rem units (16px = 1rem) or Tailwind utilities  
- **Layout**: CSS flexbox, grid, or positioning
- **Typography**: Font size, weight, line-height adjustments

### File Discovery:
1. Look for CSS files: `styles.css`, `globals.css`
2. Check component files: `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`
3. Search in: `/src`, `/components`, `/pages`, `/app`

### Comments:
Add implementation comments:
```css
/* Moat Task 1: Made hero title blue for better branding */
.hero-title { color: #3B82F6; }
```

## Error Handling
If a task can't be completed:
```
‚ùå **Task [N] Issue**
Problem: [description]
Options: Skip (type "skip") or need guidance
```

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Change matches user request
‚úÖ Code follows project patterns  
‚úÖ Human has approved
‚úÖ Task marked complete

**Remember**: Quality over speed. One task at a time. Wait for approval.

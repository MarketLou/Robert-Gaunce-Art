# Moat Commands Reference

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Primary Commands:

#### `run moat`
**Full automated workflow** - Starts services + processes all pending tasks
```bash
# When you say "run moat", Cursor will:
1. âœ… Check HTTP server (port 8000) and moat-watcher  
2. ðŸ”„ Start any missing services
3. ðŸ“‹ Read current task queue from .moat files
4. ðŸŽ¨ Process ALL pending tasks automatically (no approval needed)
5. âœ… Update status files immediately  
6. ðŸŽ‰ Show completion summary with live URL
```

#### `process tasks`
**Task processing only** - Assumes services are running
```bash
# Processes all pending tasks from the queue without starting services
```

#### `start moat` 
**Services only** - Starts services without processing tasks
```bash
# Just starts HTTP server and watcher without task processing
```

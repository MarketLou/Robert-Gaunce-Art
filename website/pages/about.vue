            <strong>Controlled Chaos.</strong> This describes my work and my medium of choice, watercolors. 
            The watercolor paint has a mind of its own, it must be controlled but at the same time given 
            space to let the water and paint do what it wants. Through my studies, I have affiliated myself 
            and my work with that of the traditional and classically trained artist. This is evident in my 
            subject matter as it consists of nature, wildlife, and the human form.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Prior to studying for my Bachelors of Art in Art Area at Morehead State University, I worked 
            exclusively in graphite and didn't have access to many different media. During my schooling I 
            was heavily engaged in studio and art history courses that greatly expanded my horizon and 
            knowledge as an artist. I learned many new techniques and practiced multiple media that I never 
            had the opportunity to try. I specifically reveled in my 2-D studies, including drawing and 
            painting. I was challenged by bettering myself technically and conceptually. I was taught how 
            to make successful compositions and studied the painting techniques used by masters of the craft. 
            In that time I had grown increasingly close to watercolors.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Watercolors are extremely versatile and allow me to create highly naturalistic pieces or loose, 
            expressive paintings that have motion to them. The paints are easy to clean up, easy to take 
            with you, and have been one of the most challenging media I have set out to be proficient at. 
            They aren't the easiest paint to use because of the nature and fluidity of water. It is challenges 
            such as this that the medium confronts me with that has deepened my attraction to them. My work 
            is largely inspired by the practices and subjects of traditional art, however, my artwork blends 
            these traditional techniques with contemporary approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            I render my subjects realistically as a traditional painter, but use expressive colors and abstracted 
            backgrounds that one wouldn't find in naturalistic imagery. I work around this tumultuous nature 
            of watercolors through the technique of "line and wash" (ink drawing with watercolors). With a 
            controlled line drawing of my subject, I am able to let the chaos of the watercolor ensue. 
            Though the drawing is traditional in the aspect of rendering, the color and application of paint 
            in my art leans towards contemporary techniques and could be described as explosive and chaotic. 
            This medium grants me the freedom to express myself fluidly and loosely or with immense detail 
            and atmosphere, and my aim is to be adept in both of these methods.

- Prepared for Medusa backend integration without requiring it to exist yet

### Notes for User
- All pages are SSR-ready and SEO-optimized
- Forms currently use console.log and alerts (need backend/email integration)
- Shop products are placeholders (will be replaced by Medusa backend)
- Portfolio artwork is placeholder cards (need real images from Robert)
- Vercel deployment can be done when ready (only requires GitHub connection)
